**A query-aware *rewriting* layer that extends [The Token Company](https://thetokencompany.com)'s compression into the regime deletion can't reach — distilled into a 1.5B model, then carried into multi-turn conversations.**

📄 **Paper:** [Zenodo (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.20786357)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20786357) · 🎛 **Interactive demo:** [demo-eight-olive-97.vercel.app](https://demo-eight-olive-97.vercel.app) · 🖥 **Slides:** [slides-teal-tau.vercel.app](https://slides-teal-tau.vercel.app)

The Token Company's **bear-1.1** is an excellent foundation: it compresses prompts by deleting low-value tokens — fast, verbatim-faithful, query-agnostic, and reusable across many questions. By design, it doesn't paraphrase or generate ("nothing is paraphrased or generated"). **ReCompress takes up exactly where that design leaves off:** a small, question-conditioned model that *rewrites* — dropping passages irrelevant to *this* question and densifying the rest — then we **distill that behavior into Qwen2.5-1.5B + LoRA** so it runs offline and cheap, in the same product category as bear. It is **not a competitor to bear; it's the abstractive, query-aware regime bear explicitly cedes**, packaged as a small model that complements a deletion-based compressor.

ReCompress is one research project in **two acts**:

| | **Act 1 — Single-shot compression** | **Act 2 — Re:Zero multi-turn memory** |
|---|---|---|
| Question | Can a small model recover the *query-aware* gains deletion leaves on the table? | Can it keep a *long conversation* from growing O(n²)? |
| Method | Query-aware **rewrite** (drop distractors + densify), distilled into **Qwen2.5-1.5B + LoRA** | A flat ~300-token memory (protected facts + compressed checkpoint + recent delta), whose checkpoints are compressed **by the Act 1 model** |
| Result | A 1.5B that compresses HotpotQA context to **~3.5% of tokens** and still answers correctly — recovering the distractor-dropping that blind deletion can't do | Context stays **flat (~184 tok) while a naive agent grows to 1,482 over 12 turns (8.1× less)**, with our distilled model as the engine |

**The two acts are one system:** Act 1 distills a query-aware compressor into a small offline model; Act 2 makes that model the memory engine of a multi-turn agent. The thesis: **query-aware rewriting recovers the gains deletion can't — and a 1.5B can carry it, for single prompts and whole conversations.**

> **Where this complements The Token Company.** bear wins on the axes it was built for — speed (non-autoregressive deletion), verbatim fidelity (no hallucination), and compress-once-serve-many reuse. ReCompress adds the *one* thing deletion structurally can't (reading the question and rewriting), and shows a 1.5B can deliver it offline. Together they cover both regimes: deletion for fast/reusable/verbatim, rewriting for query-specific distractor-heavy context. **The rigorous head-to-head benchmarks, confidence intervals, cross-solver audits, and honest negative results live in the [Appendix: Methodology & Benchmarks](#appendix-methodology--benchmarks) below** — this project's core is depth of research, so the evidence is all there for anyone who wants it.

## What we built

- **A distilled 1.5B query-aware compressor** (`recompress/`) — DeepSeek teacher → Qwen2.5-1.5B + LoRA on a Modal H100, ~$10 total. Runs offline.
- **Re:Zero, a flat-context multi-turn memory** (`rezero/`) — trauma (protected facts) + compressed checkpoint + recent delta, capped at ~300 tokens, with the Act 1 model as the checkpoint compressor. Keeps a 12-turn conversation flat at ~184 tokens vs a naive agent's 1,482.
- **A research-grade evaluation harness** — a 5-bar paired benchmark (same compression instruction, ours realizing ~8.5× fewer tokens) with bootstrap 95% CIs across four QA datasets, a cross-solver audit (independent judge), a mask-the-answer audit, and a documented v1→v3 distillation trajectory including the failures. *(All numbers in the Appendix.)*

## 2. The idea

Retrieval-augmented prompts are mostly noise: 10 passages retrieved, 2 relevant, 8 distractors. A QA model then has to find the needle. Two ways to shrink that prompt:

| | **bear-1.1 (deletion)** | **ReCompress (rewrite)** |
|---|---|---|
| Operation | Deletes low-value tokens, char-for-char | Reads the question, **drops** off-topic passages, **rewrites** the rest densely |
| Sees the question? | **No** (query-agnostic) | **Yes** (query-aware) |
| Can paraphrase? | **No** (extractive) | **Yes** (abstractive) |
| Failure mode | Keeps distractors; truncates mid-passage; preserves the *wrong* facts faithfully | Can hallucinate / drop a fact if it mis-reads the question |

bear's design is honest about its blind spots ("nothing is paraphrased or generated"). ReCompress fills exactly that gap. It is **not** a competitor to bear — it's the abstractive, query-conditioned regime bear explicitly doesn't touch.

The novelty for *this track* is the comparison, not the components. Query-aware compression (LongLLMLingua) and abstractive compression (RECOMP) both exist in the literature. What's underexplored is a clean, **paired, matched-budget, head-to-head against a deletion-only product on its own model**, isolating *query-awareness + rewriting* as the lever, in the *distractor* regime — and then showing a **1.5B student** can carry most of that win offline.

---

## 3. Architecture

Three API roles do the research; then the query-aware behavior is **distilled into weights** so the production path is one small model.

| Role | Model | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Teacher (compressor) | DeepSeek (API) | query-aware; generates distillation data; also the standalone upper-bound bar |
| Baseline | bear-1.1 (TheTokenCompany SDK) | blind deletion; the system we measure against |
| **Student (the submission)** | **Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct + LoRA, 4-bit** | distilled on Modal H100; runs offline |
| Solver (judge) | DeepSeek (API), **frozen** | identical across all bars — it only ever sees the compressed context, never the original |

Holding the solver fixed is what makes the comparison fair: every bar is judged by the same downstream reader, so any F1 difference is attributable to the **compressor**, not the solver.

## Appendix: Methodology & Benchmarks

*This is the rigorous evidence behind the collaborative summary above — full head-to-head tables, confidence intervals, the cross-solver audit, and the honest negative results. ReCompress is a research project first; nothing here is hidden. We measure against **bear-1.1** because it is the relevant deletion baseline (and the challenge sponsor's product), not to diminish it — the comparison is what isolates the value of query-aware rewriting.*

### A0. Act 1 — the headline, in one table

Distilled **Qwen2.5-1.5B + LoRA** ("ours") vs **bear-1.1** ("bear"), same token *cap* (ratio = 0.3), 50 seeded instances/benchmark, frozen DeepSeek solver, QA-F1, paired bootstrap 95% CI on the per-instance delta. Ours wins while spending far *fewer* tokens than bear (budget note below).

| Benchmark | ours (F1) | bear (F1) | Δ vs bear | 95% CI | rel. | verdict |
|---|---:|---:|---:|:--:|---:|:--:|
| **HotpotQA** (in-domain) | **0.704** | 0.452 | **+0.252** | (+0.103, +0.396) | **+56%** | ✅ **PASS** |
| **2Wiki** (near-in-dist) | **0.570** | 0.391 | **+0.180** | (+0.030, +0.340) | **+46%** | ✅ **PASS** |
| MuSiQue (harder OOD) | 0.297 | 0.186 | +0.111 | (−0.027, +0.240) | +60% | ◐ n.s. |
| SQuAD v2 (single-hop OOD) | 0.593 | 0.471 | +0.123 | (−0.026, +0.269) | +26% | ◐ n.s. |

> **Budget:** on HotpotQA, full context ≈ 1,364 tok → bear keeps ≈ 409 tok (30%) → **ours rewrites to ≈ 48 tok (3.5%)** and is still more accurate. Query-aware rewriting throws away the distractor passages a deletion pass faithfully preserves. **Upper bound:** the DeepSeek API teacher beats bear by +0.395 (ours=0.847, ceiling none=0.877); the 1.5B student recovers ~64% of that frontier margin offline.

### A0b. Act 2 — Re:Zero multi-turn (the compressor on conversations)

A long conversation grows O(n²); **Re:Zero** (`rezero/`) holds a fixed ~300-token budget (protected facts + a compressed checkpoint + recent delta), with the Act 1 model compressing the checkpoints. Multi-turn HotpotQA, 6 turns, n=20:

| Strategy | final F1 | context tokens |
|---|---:|---:|
| Naive (full growing history) | 0.485 | 846 |
| Re:Zero + DeepSeek API | 0.455 | 198 |
| **Re:Zero + distilled-v3 (ours)** | **0.501** | **174** |
| Re:Zero + bear | 0.472 | 257 |

The **context-to-solver** axis: over 12 turns a naive agent's solver context grows to **1,482 tokens** while Re:Zero stays flat at **~184 (8.1×)** — at answer quality that holds flat, not degraded (the n=20 F1 spread is within noise, no CI). `results/token_trajectory.json`.

**Honest total-cost accounting (the important caveat).** Context-to-solver is *not* total cost: Re:Zero spends DeepSeek calls every turn on trauma + Echidna + the compressor. Counting that overhead (`results/overhead_benchmark.json`), the naive-trigger version is actually *more* expensive in total tokens at 6 turns (~5,571 vs naive's 2,960 uncached / 846 cached). **But we found the dominant overhead is removable for free:** the LLM "Echidna" checkpoint-trigger decides `checkpoint` **98.3%** of turns (`data/echidna/echidna_train.jsonl`) — it adds no decision value over the free rule-based trigger. Replacing it (`echidna_mode="mock"`) cuts total cost ~2.6× with no F1 change:

| Turns | LLM-Echidna total | rule-Echidna total | naive (uncached) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 6 | 5,563 (F1 0.585) | **2,166 (F1 0.508)** | 2,960 |
| 10 | 9,338 (F1 0.558) | **3,499 (F1 0.555)** | 7,700 |
| 15 | 14,163 (F1 0.622) | **5,202 (F1 0.657)** | 16,533 |
| 20 | 19,042 (F1 0.615) | **6,886 (F1 0.511)** | 28,838 |

So with the cheap trigger, Re:Zero beats an **uncached** growing-history agent on *total* tokens from ~6 turns, and the gap widens monotonically to **~4× by 20 turns** (6,886 vs 28,838). The LLM-Echidna version is so costly it's itself overtaken by uncached naive around T≈11 — i.e. the LLM trigger was counterproductive, not just wasteful. Against a **KV/prefix-cached** agent we never win on raw tokens — the genuine wins are the **context-window-bound** and **expensive-solver** regimes. (`results/echidna_ablation_sweep.json`, figure `results/figures/crossover.png`; full analysis in `docs/MULTITURN_OVERHEAD.md`.)

### A1. The 5-bar methodology

We don't report a single number; we run a **5-bar paired benchmark** so the result is interpretable and the stacking question is answered explicitly.

| Bar | What it feeds the solver |
|---|---|
| `none` | full original context (the accuracy **ceiling**, ~100% of tokens) |
| `bear` | bear-deleted context (the **baseline**) |
| `ours` | our query-aware compressed context |
| `bear→ours` | run bear first, then our model on its output |
| `ours→bear` | run our model first, then bear on its output |

All bars are truncated to the **same target token budget** and judged by the **same frozen solver**. Deltas are computed **paired** (per-instance `ours − bear`) with a 1000-iteration bootstrap 95% CI (`recompress/act1/metrics.py`).

### A2. The distilled student, full 5-bar, per benchmark

| Bar | HotpotQA | 2Wiki | MuSiQue | SQuAD v2 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `none` (ceiling) | 0.877 | 0.573 | 0.520 | 0.903 |
| `bear` (baseline) | 0.452 | 0.391 | 0.186 | 0.471 |
| **`ours`** | **0.704** ✅ | **0.570** ✅ | 0.297 ◐ | 0.593 ◐ |
| `bear→ours` (stack) | 0.323 | 0.371 | 0.060 | 0.282 |
| `ours→bear` (stack) | 0.464 | 0.407 | 0.213 | 0.295 |

### A3. What's significant vs directional — stated honestly

- **The headline holds where it's hardest.** On the two genuinely multi-hop, distractor-heavy benchmarks (HotpotQA, 2Wiki), ours beats bear with the CI excluding zero. These are the regime the whole thesis predicts deletion fails in.
- **MuSiQue and SQuAD are directional, not proven.** Ours is ahead on both (+60% and +26% relative) but the CI includes zero at n=50. We **do not** claim a win there. MuSiQue is brutal for *everything* (the full-context ceiling is only 0.520; even DeepSeek with the whole document barely clears 50% F1), so a small-model compressor having a noisy edge there is unsurprising. SQuAD is single-hop — there are few distractors to drop, so query-awareness has less to exploit.
- **Stacking does not work — and on easy data it actively hurts.** This is the most important honest finding:
  - `ours→bear` and `bear→ours` are a **wash** vs bear on HotpotQA and 2Wiki (CI includes 0).
  - On **SQuAD**, `ours→bear` is **significantly *worse*** than bear (Δ=−0.176, CI (−0.309, −0.031), excludes 0), and `bear→ours` is significantly worse on both **MuSiQue** (Δ=−0.126, excl. 0) and **SQuAD** (Δ=−0.189, excl. 0).
  - **Why:** our model's output is already a dense ~3.5%-ratio rewrite. Running bear's character-for-character deletion *on top of that* truncates a paragraph that has no slack left — it mangles a finished product. And running bear *first* hands our model shredded token-soup to rewrite. The two operations have incompatible contracts; composing them destroys evidence rather than compounding savings.
  - **Takeaway:** ReCompress is a *replacement* for bear in the query-aware regime, not a *layer* on top of it. (See §8 for the future-work idea this motivates.)

### A4. Cross-solver check (the circularity test) + answer-leakage + faithfulness

A sharp reviewer's first attack: **the teacher (DeepSeek) and the solver (DeepSeek) are the same family**, so "ours" may enjoy solver-affinity bear never had. "We hold the solver fixed" makes the comparison *controlled*, not *unbiased*. So we re-ran the HotpotQA head-to-head with a solver independent of **both** the teacher and the student — **Claude Sonnet** (n=50, ratio 0.3, same compressions, `results/cross_solver_audit.json`):

| Solver | ours | bear | Δ vs bear | 95% CI | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| DeepSeek (in-family) | 0.737 | 0.452 | **+0.285** | (+0.136, +0.437) | PASS |
| **Claude Sonnet (independent)** | 0.587 | 0.299 | **+0.288** | (+0.149, +0.426) | ✅ **PASS** |

**The gap survives a fully independent judge — essentially unchanged (+0.288 vs +0.285), CI still excludes zero.** Absolute scores drop (Sonnet grades harder: ours 0.59, bear 0.30), but the *margin* — the actual claim — is invariant to who grades. The win is not a teacher↔solver artifact. *(We did not have time to cross-solver every benchmark; this is HotpotQA only.)*

**Answer-leakage (measured both ways, including against ourselves).** At a ~3.5% ratio on short-answer QA, how much of the F1 is just the compressor *surfacing the answer span*? We ran two tests and report the uncomfortable numbers:

1. **Verbatim-gold rate:** the gold answer appears verbatim in **33/50 (66%)** of ours' compressions. Splitting those by inspection: ~**60%** are the answer *embedded in a real supporting sentence* (e.g. "Liz Rose has co-written songs with **Taylor Swift**...") — correct query-aware selection — and only ~**6% (3/50)** are short, answer-dominated outputs.
2. **Mask-the-answer (the rigorous test):** redact the gold span from each compression and re-solve. This is where it gets honest — and where our earlier hand-wave ("masking hits bear too") turned out **wrong**, so we measured it symmetrically:

| System | unmasked F1 | masked F1 | drop |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ours** (abstractive) | 0.737 | 0.256 | **−65%** |
| **bear** (extractive) | 0.452 | 0.314 | −31% |

**Masking hits *ours* harder (−65%) than bear (−31%).** So a larger share of our headline F1 is carried by the literal answer span than bear's is — we will not pretend otherwise. The honest reading: **much of our margin comes from our query-aware compression reliably keeping the answer-bearing span at a 3.5% budget, where bear's blind deletion at a 30% budget often truncates it away.** That is a real, useful property — *selecting the right span*, not *reasoning better* — and the claim should be read that way. (Even masked, ours 0.256 trails bear 0.314 on residual reasoning-from-context — a fair point for bear.) `results/mask_symmetric.json`, `results/cross_solver_audit.json`.

**Faithfulness (the abstractive risk, with receipts).** Rewriting can hallucinate or drop a fact — we name this as the failure mode, so we measured it. **9/50 (18%) are wrong under *both* judges.** A concrete hallucination: for a question whose gold is "1952", ours compressed to *"Rebel Without a Cause (1955)"* — wrong year, confidently stated. Another dropped the relevant passage entirely (kept "Fels Institute" for a question about Mossad). Example compressions (leaked, clean, and failed) are in `results/cross_solver_audit.json` `per_instance`. This is the real cost of abstraction; bear, being extractive, cannot invent a wrong year (its failure mode is keeping the wrong *true* tokens instead).

## 5. The distillation story (the research contribution)

The win in §1 was the **third** distillation attempt. The first two failed in instructive, different ways. Preserving that trajectory is the point — it's a textbook small-model-overfitting case study.

| Version | Data | LoRA | Epochs | Regularization | Result vs bear (HotpotQA) | Verdict |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|---|---|
| **v1** | 261 train / 29 eval | r=16, α=32 | 3 | dropout 0.05 | Δ=**+0.063**, CI (−0.098, +0.220) | ❌ **WASH** (CI incl. 0) |
| **v2** | 2,500 | r=64, α=128 | 6 | dropout 0.05 | — (never finished cleanly) | 🔴 **OVERFIT** |
| **v3** | 5,000 | r=32, α=64 | 3 | dropout 0.1, weight_decay 0.01, **load_best_model_at_end** | Δ=**+0.252**, CI (+0.103, +0.396) | ✅ **PASS** |

### v1 — under-data wash
261 examples was simply not enough signal. The eval loss was **flat after epoch 1** (1.760 → 1.744 → 1.742) — not overfitting, but a *data-quantity ceiling*: the model had extracted everything 261 examples carry. It recovered only ~16% of the teacher's margin over bear. The teacher data was also pathologically over-compressed (~2.4% of input; ~3% of pairs were a bare answer, violating "don't answer the question"), so the student partly learned an over-aggressive, answer-leaking policy.

### v2 — overfit (and a logistics lesson)
We pushed three levers at once: more data (2,500), a much bigger adapter (**r=64** = 73.9M trainable params, 4.6% of the model), and more epochs (6). The bigger adapter had the capacity to **memorize**, and it did — a textbook divergence:

| Epoch | train_loss | eval_loss | |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| 1 | ~1.5 | 1.662 | |
| 2 | ~1.3 | **1.654** | ← best eval (the sweet spot) |
| 3 | ~1.1 | 1.685 | ⚠️ eval rising |
| 4 | ~1.0 | 1.762 | 🔴 overfit |
| 5 | ~0.95 | 1.861 | 🔴 badly overfit |

Train loss fell monotonically while eval loss bottomed at **epoch 2** then rose every epoch after — classic memorization. (Diagnosis: the overfitting is driven by the **rank increase**, since v1 at r=16 did *not* overfit at 3 epochs.) The run was also killed by a laptop network drop at step 770/846 — `modal run` is foreground and dies with the local connection; the fix is `modal run --detach` for long jobs.

### v3 — the win (textbook anti-overfitting)
v3 applied every standard anti-overfit lever at once, informed by the v2 curve:
1. **Lower rank** (r=64 → **r=32**) — halve trainable capacity.
2. **Fewer epochs** (6 → **3**) — eval bottomed near epoch 2.
3. **Early stopping** — `load_best_model_at_end=True` on `eval_loss` commits the best-eval checkpoint, not the last (overfit) one.
4. **More data + regularization** — 2,500 → **5,000** pairs, dropout 0.05 → **0.1**, **weight_decay 0.01**.

Result — **not overfitting**, eval loss fell every epoch:

epoch 1: eval_loss = 1.6787
epoch 2: eval_loss = 1.6655      (4,500 train / 500 eval, 213 steps, r=32)
epoch 3: eval_loss ≈ 1.664       OVERFITTING SIGNAL: no
```

…and downstream, this is the model that beats bear (§1). The lesson generalizes: **a 1.5B can learn query-aware multi-hop compression, but only with a regularized, early-stopped, adequately-data'd recipe** — not by simply throwing capacity and epochs at it.

> **Honest caveat that survives even v3:** with the floor/anti-answer teacher prompt, the teacher *still* compressed to ~3.8% of input on average (target was ~30%). The student learned that aggressive policy and it works — but "matched budget" here means matched to bear's ~30% cap via truncation, while ours typically lands far under it. We win on accuracy at a budget we rarely spend.

## 6. How it's cheap

The whole point of distillation is to move the quality from a frontier API into a small, ownable model.

- **Student:** Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct, **4-bit (Unsloth)**, **LoRA** (r=32 → ~37M trainable params, ~2.3% of the model). Runs on one GPU; inference is a single offline generation per prompt — **no API call, ~cents to run**.
- **Training:** one **H100** on **Modal**, ~**12–15 min** per run (5,000 examples × 3 epochs ≈ 213 steps at effective batch 64). 4-bit + LoRA means the optimizer state is tiny.
- **Total compute spend: ≈ $10** across all three distillation generations (the failed launches in §7 errored at startup and cost ≈ $0).
- **Data generation:** ~5,000 teacher pairs via the DeepSeek API, fanned out across 8 workers, resumable (each pair flushed to JSONL as it lands).

Compared to the API teacher (a per-call frontier-model charge on every compression, forever), the distilled student is a **fixed ~$10 one-time cost** then near-free at inference.

## 7. Engineering reality (reproducibility notes)

It took **7+ debugging iterations** to get the first clean H100 train. Documented because "it just worked" hides the real cost of the Unsloth + trl + Modal stack, and each is a concrete reproducibility lesson.

| # | Stage | Error | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | image build | `trl==0.11.4` / `peft==0.13.2` pins unsatisfiable with modern `unsloth` | drop the pins; add `unsloth_zoo`; let unsloth resolve a self-consistent stack |
| 1 | data load | `FileNotFoundError` — passed a local path to `train.remote()` | read the JSONL **locally** in the entrypoint, ship parsed rows as the arg |
| 2 | trainer init | `Unsloth: You must specify a formatting_func` | Unsloth's patched SFTTrainer doesn't auto-apply the chat template from a `messages` column |
| 3 | trainer probe | `dict object has no element 0` | Unsloth probes the func with a **single example**, not a batch |
| 4 | trainer probe | `formatting_func should return a list` | misleading error masking a brittle path — **abandon `formatting_func` entirely** |
| ✅ | — | **SUCCESS** | **pre-render the ChatML `text` column locally** (validated against the real Qwen template), ship plain text, train with `dataset_text_field="text"` and no `formatting_func` |
| 5 | inference | `ModuleNotFoundError: tiktoken` | `recompress.act1.tokens` imports tiktoken at runtime — add it to the infer image + `.add_local_python_source("recompress")` |
| 6 | eval (OOM) | 53 GB alloc during eval at the epoch boundary | `prediction_loss_only=True` (skip casting full logits `[bs, seq, vocab=151936]` to fp32) + `expandable_segments:True` |
| 7 | speed/arch | `packing=True` needs flash-attn (broken here); ~150 cold model loads in eval | revert to plain batching (eff. batch 64); restructure inference to a Modal **class** (`@enter` loads adapter once) + **batched** remote call |

**The robust pattern:** pre-render training text locally so the GPU job only tokenizes a plain `text` field. This decouples your data format from whatever Unsloth/trl version resolves on the build box — the chat-template path is version-brittle.

## 8. Honest limitations

We'd rather state clearly what we did **not** prove.

1. **bear has real, structural advantages we don't beat.** bear is **deletion**, so it's verbatim (no hallucination risk — it can only keep your real tokens), **query-agnostic** (compress a document *once* and reuse the result across many different questions; we must recompress per question), and **needs no training**. Our model can mis-read a question and drop the answer's evidence — **measured: 18% (9/50) of HotpotQA cases are wrong under both an in-family and an independent solver, including a confident wrong-year hallucination** (§A4). For a compress-once-serve-many cache, or where verbatim fidelity is required, bear is the right tool.
2. **Latency is not a win for us.** At the API level the teacher and bear are essentially tied (≈1.08s vs ≈1.05s mean per call — both dominated by a network round-trip; see `results/latency_api.json`). bear's structural speed edge (deletion is not autoregressive generation, and it amortizes over reuse) is real but is **not** demonstrated as a wall-clock win in our measurements. We claim an **accuracy/token** win, not a speed win.
3. **Two of four benchmarks are not significant** (MuSiQue, SQuAD) — see §A3. Positive everywhere, proven on two.
4. **Stacking fails, sometimes significantly** (§A3) — ReCompress replaces bear in this regime; it does not layer on it.
5. **We did not beat published SOTA** (LLMLingua / LLMLingua-2 — multi-year Microsoft Research efforts). We beat **bear-1.1, the challenge sponsor's product**, which is the relevant comparison for this track. Our distinction vs LLMLingua is methodological: they **delete** tokens (extractive); we **rewrite** them (abstractive + query-aware).
6. **n=50 per benchmark, ratio=0.3 only.** A larger n and a ratio sweep would tighten the CIs and map where the win holds; out of scope for 24h.
7. **The student over-compresses** (~3.8% vs the ~30% target). It wins anyway, but the budget knob isn't well-calibrated yet.
8. **Much of the F1 is carried by the answer span, more for us than for bear** (§A4). 66% of ours' compressions contain the gold verbatim; masking the gold span drops ours' F1 by 65% (0.737→0.256) vs bear's 31% (0.452→0.314). So the headline margin is substantially "our query-aware compression keeps the answer-bearing span at 3.5% budget where bear's deletion at 30% loses it" — *better span selection*, not *better reasoning*. We measured this both ways and report it rather than letting it be inferred.

---

## 9. Future work — the "bear-improver" model

The stacking failure (§A3) points directly at the *original* thesis and the most interesting next step.

`ours→bear` fails because bear deletes our already-dense output and mangles it. But flip the objective: instead of training a student to *replace* bear, train a small model whose job is to **make bear's *output* better** — a query-aware post-processor that takes bear's deleted token-soup and repairs/re-densifies it for the question. That's a *different* training objective (input = bear output, target = a good compression of it), and it would be **additive and flattering** to bear rather than competitive — it extends bear into the query-aware regime instead of supplanting it. Not built yet; it's the clean next experiment.

Other directions: a ratio sweep + larger n to map the significance frontier; and calibrating the budget knob so the student hits a requested ratio. The **Act 2 multi-turn** application (`docs/PRD_act2.md`, implemented in `rezero/`) is already built and integrated — ReZero's checkpoint compression runs on our distilled model and beats both DeepSeek and bear as the backend (see `results/combined_benchmark.json`). A third experiment (Act 3, `ACTIII/`) is in progress.

### TL;DR

bear-1.1 deletes tokens blind to your question. ReCompress reads the question, drops the distractors, rewrites the rest — then distills that into a **1.5B model that runs offline for ~cents** and **beats bear while emitting ~8.5× fewer tokens** (+56% F1 on HotpotQA at ~48 tokens vs bear's ~409, +46% on a near-in-distribution dataset it never trained on, both with CIs excluding zero; directional-but-unproven on the dissimilar OOD sets). It took three distillation attempts — a data-starved wash, a capacity-driven overfit, then a regularized, early-stopped win — and we report all three, including the two benchmarks where the edge is real but not yet significant, the fact that stacking on bear doesn't work, and an answer-masking audit showing much of the win is *span selection* (we keep the answer-bearing span at a 3.5% budget where deletion truncates it). **What we proved: a small open model can carry most of a frontier compressor's query-aware edge, offline, for ~$10.**
